To run the codes you need the following packages in Julia: ProxSDP, JuMP, LinearAlgebra, DynamicPolynomials, DelimitedFiles

How to Run:

1) Run  "Main_SDP.m" to generate the standard SDP of the "risk assessment" problem.

2) Run "SDP_Julia_JuMP.jl" to solve the SDP.

3) Run "Main_Plot.m" to plot the polynomial solution of the SDP (i.e., polynomial indicator function)
